CP4163 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical ChemistryTopic 9 –Pharmacokinetics and Drug Administration1Drug Delivery System The process of delivering drugs to the body's tissues involves 3 separate phases: Pharmaceutical phase (Drug administration) Pharmacokinetic phase (ADME) Pharmacodynamic phase (Drug-receptor)2Drug Delivery DosageForm drug Body Tissues or Pharmaceutical Phase• how drugs are introduced into the body• drug preparations (dosage forms) depend on medication formHow the body handles the drughow administered drugs move to the target sites• drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination (ADME)• drug bioavailabilityWhat the drug does to the body• drug effect at the target sites• drug-receptor interaction• drug action at enzymes and nucleic acids• agonists and antagonists3Pharmaceutical Phase4Pharmaceutical PhaseThis is sometimes also called the drug administration phase, is the means by which drugs are introduced into the body
Choices vary depending on:What form?(i) pharmaceutical formulation /dosage form of drug (ii) appropriate route of administration.From where?5(i) Drug formulation/dosage form  Dosage Form the form in which a drug is administered subdivided according to physical nature into formulations6(i) Drug formulation/dosage form Formulationsliquids• e.g
solutions, suspensions, emulsionssemisolids• e.g
creams, ointments, gelssolids• e.g
tablets, capsules, suppositories.gases• e.g
sprays, mists, aerosols, inhalers• move quickly throughout body• but must penetrate membranes to produce effectsolids must disintegrate & dissolve before they can become activeslow onset of action• fastest absorption rate• less compacted• move to target site more easily7(i) Drug formulation/dosage form  Dosage Form active ingredient (drug, API) inert ingredients (excipients) Excipients serves a number of functions, e.g. fillers (bulk forming) lubricants (reduce frictional wear on processing equipment) binders (aid adhesion of particles in formulation) disintegrants (aid release of active ingredient) preservatives (extend shelf life) exert significant effect on release of active ingredient from dosage form8(i) Drug formulation/dosage form  Dosage Regimen dose of a drug and how it is administered vary  from single dose  to regular daily doses  to continuous IV infusions designed to maintain the drug concentration within the therapeutic window or range at site of action9(i) Drug formulation/dosage form Example: Amoxicillin, 50mg1 Capsule, 3 times daily(Given 12 capsules in packet)It means dose of drug = 50mg
2 capsules – Dose = 100mgIt is administered orally, 1 capsule , 3 times a day for 4 days10(ii) Routes of Drug administration3 Main Routes of AdministrationDrug AdministrationEnteral• Oral• Sublingual• Buccal• NasogastricTopical• Skin• Membranous   linings (lungs, eyes, etc) Parenteral• Injection / infusions Note common spelling errors11(ii) Routes of Drug administration Enteral Administration Advantage large absorptive surfaces of oral mucosa (mouth), stomach or small intestine Oral e.g
tablets, capsules most common, most convenient, usually least costly skin's protective barrier not broken  safe Disadvantages some drugs get inactivated by gastric acid & digestive enzymes drugs must first travel to the liver (1st pass effect) before entering the general circulation to reach the target site12(ii) Routes of Drug administration Enteral Administration Sublingual placed under the tongue & allowed to dissolve slowly rich blood supply under tongue  rapid onset of action formulations rapidly disintegrating tablets, soft gelatin capsules filled with liquid drug Buccal placed in the oral cavity between the gum & cheek absorbed more slowly than sublingual route suitable for sustained-release drug delivery e.g
nicotine chewing gum for smoking cessation13(ii) Routes of Drug administration Enteral Administration Nasogastric (NG) NG tube = nose    stomach drugs are usually in liquid form14(ii) Routes of Drug administration Topical Administration drugs applied locally to: skin, eye, ear, nose, respiratory tract, rectum Formulations creams, lotions, gels, powders, sprays, drops, inhalers Effect can be local - effect only at site of application, very small amounts absorbed into the general circulation systemic - drug released and absorbed into general circulation15(ii) Routes of Drug administration Topical Administration Local topical delivery of drugs produces fewer side effects compared with the same drugs given orally or parenterally because they are absorbed very slowlyand only small amounts reach the general circulation. Some drugs are given topically to ensure slow release and absorption of the drug into the general circulation to produce systemic effects. Drugs applied topically should generally not be applied to abraded or broken skin, except for antiseptics.16(ii) Routes of Drug administration Parenteral Administration via a needle into the skin layers angled at different degrees intradermal (ID), subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM), intravenous (IV) more invasive than topical or enteral administration aseptic technique prevent entry of microbes Parenteral administration: bypasses enzymes of digestive tract & first-pass effect of liver Rapid onset of action IV > IM > ID or SC17IMSCIVID18Intravenous CannulaIntravenous injection – 1 shotIntravenous infusion – drip by drip19Pharmacokinetic PhaseAction of Drugs in the Body20Pharmacokinetic phase The study of how the body handles a drug It attempts to quantify ADME drug absorption (A) drug distribution (D) drug metabolism (M) drug elimination (E)ADEM21Therapeutic Window/Rangerange of plasma concentration over which a drug is therapeutically effectiveBetween therapeutic concentration and toxic concentration.22Fig 9.5CmaxToxic concentration(Side effects)Therapeutic WindowTherapeutic Concentration(Min Effective Conc)Question: So how long is the duration of drug action from the graph?

Prednisone (a synthetic corticosteroid drug), is converted by the liver into the active drug prednisolone, which is also a steroid
30Pharmacokinetic phase Drug Elimination irreversible removal of the active form of drug from the body methods:  degradative metabolism  all forms of excretion main excretion routes: kidneys - in solution in urine bowel - faeces other excretion routes: exhalation, sweating, breast feeding31Pharmacokinetic phaseBioavailability Bioavailability is the fraction of the administered dose of unchanged drug that reaches the systemic blood circulation. Intravenous administration immediate absorption Other routes of administration Usually a small time lapse before drug reaches the blood (= This is the time taken for a drug to reach the site of absorption)32Pharmacokinetic phaseBioavailability Amount of drug absorbed calculated from the total area under the concentration-time curve 100% for drugs administered intravenouslyFig 9.10AUC IVOral Bioavailability = (AUC oral / AUC IV) x 100%Area under the curve (AUC)reflects the amount of unchanged drug absorbed into systemic circulationAUC oralThe rate at which a drug reaches the systemic circulation is reflected as the time taken to reach maximum plasma concentration

Drug factors2
Patient factors3
Drug Interactions (in GIT)4
First Pass Effect – drug stability in the hepatic portal circulation and liver351
Drug Factors Aqueous and lipid solubilities of drugdetermines dissolution ratedetermines ease of membrane permeation Type of dosage form determines rate and extent of release of active drugBioavailability: liquid preparations > liquid suspension > solids Nature of excipients affects release of drug from dosage form Manufacturing process e.g
tablet compression force  hard / soft tablets affect drug release and dissolution Particle size & crystalline forms of drug influence drug dissolution362.Patient Factors pH of gastrointestinal fluids Gastric-emptying rate Gastrointestinal motility rate Disease states 372
Patient Factors pH of gastrointestinal fluids  affects drug solubility affects degree of ionization of drug e.g
basic drug - more soluble in acidic than alkaline pH non-ionised fraction  more lipid soluble  easier movement across cell membranes & vice versa Gastric-emptying rate rate at which drug is discharged from the stomach determines the rate of absorption in the small intestine382
Patient Factors Gastrointestinal motility rate determines transit rate through small intestine determines the time available for drug dissolution and absorption Disease states  alter drug absorption characteristics  e.g
changes in gastro-emptying rate, GI motility, etc393
Drug Interactions Generally Empty stomach favours GI absorption 2 or more drugs, including food, administered in close sequence one drug may interfere with absorption of another some may form insoluble complexes or other effects e.g
tetracycline (antibacterial) + antacids (gastric)Impact: tetracycline complexes with divalent cations forming an insoluble complex404
First Pass Effect only affects orally administered drugs  drugs are absorbed into the hepatic portal circulation which carries blood directly to the liver from the upper digestive tract  the drugs can be rendered inactive by the metabolic processes in the liver before they reach the general circulation41Discussion: What happens to the curve when the ADME is not typical?(Eg: Liver failure patient, kidney failure, diarrhea)What impact on dosage regiment? What can the pharmacist do to ensure safety? Draw on Pg 104Under normal situation for a normal patient
